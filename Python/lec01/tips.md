+   Wait is important
    +   You have to wait until the precondition of the next instruction is ready for use.

            +   What if you didn't boil the water?
        +   Scrambled eggs
            +   What if you didn't scramble?
        +   Even experienced programmer may forget to initialize!

+   `int()` will convert a `float` into integer
    +   Preserve the integral part only
        +   `int(1.9)` is `1`
        +   `int(0.5)` is `0`
        +   `int(-0.9)` is `0`
        +   `int(-1.7)` is `-1`

+   Formatting `float` 
    +   With string operator `%`: [`printf` style](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#old-string-formatting)
        +   `%.3f` means print `3` digits after the decimal point.
    +   [New method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format) is complicated. Not NOW.
